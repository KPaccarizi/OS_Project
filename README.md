Starts the development mode to the browser at `http://localhost:8000`

##### Build for production

After creating the production build you can preview the build, by running:
- `npm run preview`

This script will generate all the icons from the `assets/icons` into a single component called `Icon.generated.tsx` that we can use throughout the application where we need to render an Icon.
